# Problem Statement:

* Various sensor inputs for various wafers have been supplied. A wafer (also known as a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor material used in the manufacture of integrated circuits.

* The objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a wafer has to be changed or not (i.e., whether it is functioning or not) based on the inputs from several sensors. Two classes exist: +1 and -1.
